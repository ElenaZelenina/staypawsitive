I’ve created a project on GitHub to easy our cooperation. It doesn’t mean, we will use its full functionality, we can use it just for file sharing. However, on the tasks with more than one implementer (like building pages) it would be nice to keep track (at least on Readme file) of who is doing what to avoid double working.

PS: Design folder is for design purposes only. All the Java coding and other interactivity should be done in the `src` folder.
